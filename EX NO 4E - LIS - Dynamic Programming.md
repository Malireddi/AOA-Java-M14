# EX 4E Longest Increasing Subsequence - Dynamic Programming.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
