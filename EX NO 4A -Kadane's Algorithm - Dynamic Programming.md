## DATE:
## AIM:
To Write a Java program to solve the below problem using Kadane's Algorithm.
A solar company installs solar panels around a circular grid of n buildings. Each building either generates or consumes net energy, represented by integers (+ve for generated, -ve for consumed).

The company wants to find a contiguous sequence of buildings (possibly wrapping around from the end to the beginning) that maximizes the total net energy.

Write a program to compute the maximum net energy that can be collected from any contiguous block of buildings on the circular grid.

Input Format:
First line: Integer n (number of buildings)

Second line: n space-separated integers: net energy for each building

Output Format:
A single integer: Maximum net energy collectable from a contiguous block (wrapping allowed)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^6
