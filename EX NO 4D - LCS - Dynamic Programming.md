# EX 4D Longest Common SubSequence - Dynamic Programming.
## DATE: 19/10/2025
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Constraints:

1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

        String text2 = sc.nextLine().replaceAll("\"", "");

        int lcsLength = sol.longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2);
        System.out.println("Length of Longest Common Subsequence: " + lcsLength);
