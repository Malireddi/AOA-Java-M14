## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
A Frog Jump 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Problem Statement:

A frog is at the bottom of the stairs with n steps. It can jump either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Write a program to find the number of distinct ways the frog can reach the top (n-th step).

Input Format:

A single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 45) – number of steps.
 Output Format:

A single integer – number of distinct ways to reach step n.
